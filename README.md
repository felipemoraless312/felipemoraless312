Hi there! I'm a Biomedical Engineer passionate about technology and innovation.I specialize in:

Python & MATLAB programming
Electronics & hardware integration
Signal and image processing
Biomedical systems and medical devices

I love building intelligent systems that bridge software and hardware — from real-time biomedical signal analysis to interactive simulations and embedded systems.
Always exploring new ideas in AI, robotics, medical imaging, and digital health technologies.

Let’s build something that makes a difference!
